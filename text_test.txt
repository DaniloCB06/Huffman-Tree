the heart is a bloom
shoots up through the stony ground
theres no room
no space to rent in this town
youre out of luck
and the reason that you had to care
the traffic is stuck
and youre not moving anywhere
you thought youd found a friend
to take you out of this place
someone you could lend a hand
in return for grace
its a beautiful day
sky falls you feel like
its a beautiful day
dont let it get away
youre on the road
but youve got no destination
youre in the mud
in the maze of her imagination
you love this town
even if that doesnt ring true
youve been all over
and its been all over you
its a beautiful day
dont let it get away
its a beautiful day 
touch me
take me to that other place
teach me love
i know im not a hopeless case
see the world in green and blue
see china right in front of you
see the canyons broken by cloud
see the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
see the bedouin fires at night
see the oil fields at first light
and see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
after the flood all the colors came out
day day
day day
it was a beautiful day
dont let it get away
beautiful day
touch me
take me to that other place
reach me
i know im not a hopeless case
what you dont have you dont need it now
what you dont know you can feel it somehow
what you dont have you dont need it now
dont need it now
was a beautiful day
